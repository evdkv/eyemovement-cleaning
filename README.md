Eye Movement Cleaning in R
=============================
This is a short notebook that contains an R notebook I usually
use to clean and combine datasets produced by EyeLink and EPrime â€”
two large pieces of software for eye tracking and stimuli presentation.
I used a few very simple packages from tidyverse to manipulate
the data, nothing too crazy, but there are still many challenges 
associated with using datasets produced by those software solutions.
